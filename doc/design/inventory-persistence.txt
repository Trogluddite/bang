Inventory Persistence
=====================
It is often useful to have access to the inventory that was used
during a particular Bang run.  Bang already provides the inventory
and the host variables to Ansible directly as Python objects when
executed as ``bang``, and as a JSON object output to stdout when
executed as an Ansible inventory plugin (i.e. ``bang --list``).  It
should also provide the following features:

    - Store inventory and host variables in a user-specified file.
    - Create ``latest-inventory`` symlink to inventory file after
      each Bang run.
    - Allow configuration of inventory output format (i.e. YAML or
      JSON).  Even though the Ansible inventory plugin API uses JSON
      as the serialization format, Bang's default inventory output
      should be YAML for symmetry since Bang's input format is YAML
      as well.
    - Allow configuration of above via command-line arguments,
      ~/.bangrc, or even ansible.cfg.
