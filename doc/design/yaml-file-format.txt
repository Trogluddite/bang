YAML File Format
----------------
The Bang configuration file structure came about with the following
goals in mind:

    - Readability (by humans)
    - Not another bespoke serialization format
    - Conciseness

While JSON would allow for there to be one less package dependency,
YAML was chosen as the overall serialization format because of its
focus on human readability.

In its earliest forms, Bang had its own SSH logic and used `Chef
<http://www.opscode.com/chef/>`_ for configuration management.  When
Ansible was identified as being a suitable replacement for the
builtin SSH logic and for Chef, it made even more sense to continue
using YAML for the file format because users could use the same
format for configuring Bang and for authoring Ansible playbooks.
